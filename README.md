# 👋 Hi, I’m Steven

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Principal Software Engineer with 15+ years of professional experience designing scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable systems. I've worked across startups, scale-ups, and enterprise environments — always with a deep focus on enabling teams, mentoring others, and reducing long-term technical costs.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- Architect cloud-native and event-driven systems using **Scala**, **ZIO**, **Kafka**, **Golang**, and **AWS**.
- Lead complex initiatives around **system design**, **GraphQL services**, **data pipelines**, and **resiliency**.
- Mentor engineers in **functional programming**, **architecture**, and **software craftsmanship**.
- Speak at user groups and internal tech talks on streaming architectures, testing, and functional design.
- Build open-source tools and write architectural decision records that scale with the org.
